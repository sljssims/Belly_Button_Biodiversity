# Belly Button Biodiversity

## From Bacteria to Beef
The human body is a source for thousands of different kinds of bacteria.  As a microbiologist and researcher, I have been tasked with finding the newest and best flavor supplement for substitute beef products.  Bacteria and fungi have assisted in developing many alternative meat products and bacteria species are abundant on the human body.  One area of interest is the belly button!  

We have found that many species reside within the human navel, and we want to capture that information. Subjects varying in gender, age, race, locations allowed samples of their belly button to classify and further study the bacteria that may well be then next impossible meatless burger!

### Participant Samples

The dashboard contains the sample IDs of test subjects that participated.  Selecting an ID will populate the demographic info table, top 10 bacteria cultures found table, belly button washing frequency and bacteria culture per sample tables.  To view the interactive dashboard, please visit https://sljssims.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/ for a complete view of the dashboard and data obtained.
